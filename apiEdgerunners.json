      "description": "Lucy is of Japanese and Polish descent, and was selected at a young age after having taken a proficiency test alongside 12 other children to receive training at an undisclosed Arasaka facility and become a netrunner. Being led on by the dream of serving the world's most powerful megacorp one day, got her and the others through the toughest days and training. When their training concluded, they were moved underground to participate in deep dives into the pre-DataKrash Net, as Arasaka sent them looking for knowledge that was lost. As they dove into the Net, they were susceptible to old world daemons and rogue AIs. The children were picked off one by one, and it didn't take long until only a handful of them were left. After realizing that they could pursue other dreams, instead of being enslaved by the corporation, the remaining children, including Lucy, used their netrunning skills to overwhelm the Arasaka staff and escape. While making their escape, most of the children were shot down one-by-one, and only Lucy managed to survive. After escaping, Lucy woke up in a junkyard, not planning to stay long. Roaming from place to place, eventually she ended up in Night City, no longer feeling like she was being chased by the megacorp.",

      "description": "Rebecca was an edgerunner of Night City, and is described as a short, spunky, trigger-happy solo who is always fighting with her brother Pilar. The two siblings often teamed up with Maine and his crew to conduct mercenary jobs, although their daily life outside of work was tense, since they would always fight with each other, because of Pilar's provocative behavior, this caused her to decide that she would be the only person to kill her brother someday. Rebecca first met and worked with David Martinez during the limo heist, distracting Maxim by spilling booze on him and sensually cleaning it, though this failed since Maxim noticed the key was missing, calling her a bitch, to which she replied that he was weird. During the attack in Corpo Plaza, Rebecca reunited with Lucy and told her she was glad that she was safe for David's sake but was crushed moments later by Adam Smasher, her last words being \"Fuck you\"",
